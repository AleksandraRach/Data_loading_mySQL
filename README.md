# Data_loading_mySQL-
## Summary
Itâ€™s quite common for customers to have valuable data in CSV files that need to be loaded into a data warehouse for analysis in a Business Intelligence tool. The goal of this project is to implement a process to enable the loading of a CSV file into MySQL table for future analysis. This project is estimated to take between 1 - 3 hours. 

## Objective
All lines in CSV exist in a table in MySQL

## Tasks
Use Integromat to load data from S3 into MySQL (Integromat is now make.com)
Validate data is in MySQL
Lightweight documentation showing process including validation

## CSV File
File name: popular_names_usa.csv
S3 location:
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bytecode-data-load-exercise/popular_names_usa.csv
NOTE: This file should be publicly available

## Integromat
Sign up for a free account: https://www.integromat.com/ 
Create a new "Scenario" in Integromat that loads the csv file into the MySQL
The sequence should be HTTP -> CSV -> MySQL

You will need to create table in MySQL before loading the data
